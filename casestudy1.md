## First Example

My first visualization was found on
https://ourworldindata.org/spanish-flu-largest-influenza-pandemic-in-history

The visualization on this website helps to compare global death rates between different flu-related pandemic. The focus is on the Spanish Flu (1918-1920). Even though the graphics look great, it's hard to understand the truth behind them without going through the whole report.

## Second Example
My second visualization was found on https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html

The graphics on this website help to show data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. One doens't need to read the whole report to understand what's going on. The colors are simple but they help to communicate the truth behind the data.The graphics help to answer the question: What are the US states Where the COVID 19 hit the most?

## Third Example

My third visualization comes from https://priceonomics.com/the-countries-that-store-the-most-and-least-photos/

The graphics and the report on this website show the countries with average number of pictures that people stored on their iphones. Even though that's a question that wouldn't interest most people, it is interesting to see how the number of picture stored on a iphone differs among different age groups or gender. The graphics show that on average, females had  more picture than males. Also, it shows that people ages between 25 and 34 had more pictures on their devices than any other age group.
However, the colors could have been used differently in order to communicate the truth more effectively. Using only one color makes it hard to see the truth behing the data at first glance.

## Fourth Example

This was found on https://ourworldindata.org/lonely-not-alone
The visualizations and the report try to answer the following questions: **Are people more likely to be lonely in so-called ‘individualistic’ societies?**
The graphics present the data in descending order. The colors are easy to follow. The labels are clear to read. However, the labels can make the graphics hard to understand given that the study seems to have been done during different years. I think that it would be better to group bars by years and not only by country.
